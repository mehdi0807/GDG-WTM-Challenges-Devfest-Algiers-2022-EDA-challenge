## Introduction
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an approach to extract the information enfolded in the data and summarize its main
characteristics . It is considered to be a crucial step in any data science project since it allows us to uncover patterns and
insights within our data. The expected output of this challenge is a well presented notebook that illustrates the Exploratory
Data Analysis applied to the given dataset.
